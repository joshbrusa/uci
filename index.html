        <h2>CanSat Competition</h2>
        <p>
          For my senior design project, I participated in the year-long UCI
          CanSat Competition, hosted by the American Astronautical Society. I
          was part of the mechanical team, primarily responsible for designing a
          maple seed-inspired structure that served as the payload. Our
          challenge involved dropping two of these structures from a container,
          requiring them to descend at a rate of under 20 m/s while being
          tracked. A diagram of this challenge can be seen below.

        <p>
          Throughout the project, I focused on innovating and refining the maple
          seed design, exploring various concepts and ideas. One noteworthy
          design concept, although not ultimately implemented, involved applying
          Robert Liebeck's propeller theory to create a windmill with flipped
          camber, mimicking the behavior of a maple seed. A early design of this
          is pictured below.

        </div>
        <p>
          The final design of the maple seed featured a platform made of
          polypropylene sheeting and a housing constructed from 3D-printed PLA.
          Once we settled on this design, we proceeded to assemble the physical
          maple seed. Furthermore, we assembled the entire CanSat payload by
          integrating all its components. These prototypes are pictured below.

        <h2>Engineering Conference</h2>
        <p>
          During a three-day weekend, I participated in an engineering
          conference hosted by Boeing at UCI. Initially, I joined a mechanical
          engineering team tasked with designing a fan system aimed at
          extracting CO2 from the atmosphere to combat greenhouse gas emissions.
          Our mechanical engineering team achieved first place for our
          innovative device. Subsequently, in the integration phase, our team
          collaborated with computer science, civil engineering, and biochemical
          engineering teams to develop a fully operational CO2 capture system.
          This process of integrating various designs proved to be quite
          complex, but eventually, we successfully crafted the final design.
          Regrettably, our integration team secured second place among the two
          competing integration teams. On a positive note, I received
          recognition as the most creative air mover delegate due to my
          inventive design ideas and contributions to debates. Following the
          competition, our team's final report was submitted for publication in
          the UCI library. Our final designs are depicted below.

        <h2>Aircraft Design</h2>
        <p>
          In my senior capstone course, Aircraft Design (MAE 159), I embarked on
          the design of two distinct aircraft: one tailored for long-range
          travel and another for shorter distances. The initial phase involved
          the utilization of MATLAB for the general sizing process, where I
          explored numerous facets of aircraft design. Notably, I delved into
          the relationship between operating costs and factors such as sweep and
          aspect ratio, yielding significant insights. The result of this study
          is depicted below.
        </p>
        <div class="image-container">
          <img src="images/aircraft-design-1.png" alt="aircraft-design-1" />
          <img src="images/aircraft-design-2.png" alt="aircraft-design-2" />
        </div>
        <p>
          In the latter part of the course, I shifted my focus to the
          development of CAD models for both aircraft using Solidworks. This
          phase encompassed the creation of interior layouts (LOPA),
          economy-class cross-sections, landing gear configurations, and center
          of gravity (CG) determinations. It's important to note that while
          various assumptions were made throughout the design process, both
          aircraft emerged as technically sound and functional. Nevertheless,
          the short-range aircraft proved to be the more cost-effective and
          fuel-efficient option. These final designs can be found below.

        <h2>Propellor Theory</h2>
        <p>
          During my senior year I participated in a specialized course led by
          Robert Liebeck, during which I developed a MATLAB program capable of
          emulating the processes outlined in "Design of Optimum Propellers" by
          Charles Adkins and Robert Liebeck. This MATLAB code enabled me to
          design and evaluate propellers and windmills for a wide range of
          applications, spanning from high-speed air racers to a Cessna
          aircraft. Additionally, I authored a comprehensive manual to assist
          aspiring engineers in crafting their own customized code for similar
          purposes. Some designs for an Rare Bear Air Racer propeller can be
          seen below.

        <h2>Robot Vehicle</h2>
        <p>
          During my Mechanical Systems Laboratory course (MAE 106), I designed a
          gaming controller capable of controlling a virtual robot and character
          in Agar.io. This controller was programmed using both Arduino and
          MATLAB. Additionally, I created a propulsion system for a robot using
          SolidWorks, which was designed to replicate the propulsion method
          employed in the MATLAB simulation. These designs and final result can
          be seen below.

        <h2>Neptune Probe</h2>
        <p>
          During my Astronautics course (MAE 146) I lead a team of four where we
          devised a mission with the objective of dispatching a probe to
          Neptune. The primary goal of this mission was to investigate Neptune's
          weather patterns and their correlation with its substantial internal
          heating. To accomplish this mission, we employed an Atlas V-501 rocket
          for the initial ground launch, alongside an interplanetary transfer
          maneuver involving a gravity assist from Jupiter. My role in this
          project encompassed the development of MATLAB code, conceptualizing
          the mission, and carrying out extensive research. The final trajectory
          for our rocket can be seen below.

        <h2>Weiss Lab</h2>
        <p>
          I embarked on an interdisciplinary academic journey when I became a
          member of the Weiss lab at UCI, following a recommendation from a
          graduate student during a chemistry course. While contributing to
          graduate-level research within the lab, I successfully drafted and had
          approved a UROP proposal for the upcoming summer. This proposal
          outlined the design and implementation of a continuous flow synthesis
          system, with the ultimate aim of its application in injector
          technology. However, my evolving interests in my primary area of study
          led me to make the decision to part ways with the lab before the
          commencement of the summer research period. The design of this device
          can be seen below.
