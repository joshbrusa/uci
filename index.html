        <h2>CanSat</h2>
        <p>
          For my senior design project I participated in the year long UCI
          CanSat competition, hosted by the American Astronautical Society. I
          was in the mechanical group of the project, where I primarily designed
          the maple seed like structure that behaved as the payload. Two of
          these were dropped from a container, where they had to be tracked to
          ensure decent at under 20 m/s.
        </p>

        </div>
        <p>
          During the project I mainly behaved as the maple seed designer where I
          went through a vast array of designs and ideas. A notable design that
          was not used was my application of Robert Liebeck's propeller theory
          to create a windmill of flipped camber, which would behave as a maple
          seed. The final design of the maple seed is shown in the right, where
          the platform is made of a polypropylene sheet, while the housing is
          made of 3D printed PLA.

        <p>
          After coming up with a final design the physical maple seed was
          assembled as seen on the right. Moreover, the entire payload was
          assembled after combining all elements of the CanSat.

        <h2>Engineering Conference</h2>
        <p>
          Over the span of a three day weekend I participated in the engineering
          conference at UCI hosted by Boeing. At first I was part of a
          mechanical engineering team where we created a fan system that would
          extract CO2 from the atmosphere to decrease greenhouse gases. Our team
          won first place out of the mechanical engineering teams for creating
          the device shown on the right.

        <p>
          In the integration section our team combined with computer science,
          civil, and biochemical engineering teams to create a fully functioning
          CO2 capture system. To integrate all the other designs was very
          complicated, but eventually we created the design shown on the right.
          Unfortunately, our integration team placed second out of the two
          integration teams. Additionally, I won most creative air mover
          delegate for my innovative design and debate ideas. After the
          competition our teams final report was submitted to the UCI library
          for publication.

        <h2>Aircraft Design</h2>
        <p>
          For my senior capstone course two separate aircraft were designed,
          both a long range and short range airplane. First general sizing was
          done using MATLAB. Many different aspect were tested, and the most
          notable characteristic was the trend between operating cost vs sweep
          and aspect ratio.

        </div>
        <p>
          For the second half of the course a CAD model was developed for both
          planes using solidworks. Interior layouts were made (LOPA), along with
          economy class cross sections, landing gears, and CG locations.
          Although many assumptions were made both planes are technically
          functioning designs, but the short range plane was both more
          economical and fuel efficient.

        <h2>Propellor Theory</h2>
        <p>
          During a specialization course with Robert Liebeck I created a MATLAB
          code that replicated the program described in the “Design of Optimum
          Propellers” by Charles Adkins and Robert Liebeck. With this code I was
          able to both design and analyze propellers/windmills for various
          applications ranging from air racers as shown in the right, to
          Cessna's. Moreover, I created a manual that any aspiring engineer
          could use to create their own code.

        <h2>Robot Vehicle</h2>
        <p>
          In my Mechanical Systems Laboratory course I made a gaming controller
          that was programmed in both arduino and MATLAB to steer a virtual
          robot, and character in Agar.io. Additionally, I made the propulsion
          system for a robot in solidworks, which was made to represent the
          propulsion method used in the MATLAB simulation.

        <h2>Neptune Probe</h2>
        <p>
          While working in a team of four we created a mission to send a probe
          to Neptune in order to study its weather patterns in relation to its
          high levels of internal heating. This mission utilized a Atlas V-501
          carrying a Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter from ground launch, and an
          interplanetary transfer (gravity assist) from Jupiter. For this
          project I wrote the MATLAB code, created the idea for the mission, and
          conducted the research.

        <h2>Weiss Lab</h2>
        <p>
          In a practice of interdisciplinary study I joined the Weiss lab at UCI
          after a graduate student for a chemistry course suggested I join.
          While aiding in graduate research at the lab I wrote an accepted UROP
          proposal for the summer detailing the development of a continuous flow
          synthesis system. The goal was to apply the project to injector
          technology, but I decided to part ways with the lab before the summer
          could start as I felt my interested had moved more towards my area of
          study.
